# My first React Router App

In this project, I practiced working with React Router to create a single-page application that showcases five famous Hollywood actors with Ukrainian roots: Vera Farmiga, Milla Jovovich, Mila Kunis, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Sylvester Stallone. I implemented navigation links for each actor, and by clicking on a name, users can view a dedicated component displaying information about that actor. This project helped me gain hands-on experience with React Router, organizing routes, and structuring a basic navigable React app.
